Defining the Sequelize associations
The four association types are defined in a very similar way. Let's say we have two models, A and B. Telling Sequelize that you want an association between the two needs just a function call:



const A = sequelize.define('A', /* ... */);
const B = sequelize.define('B', /* ... */);

A.hasOne(B); // A HasOne B
A.belongsTo(B); // A BelongsTo B
A.hasMany(B); // A HasMany B
A.belongsToMany(B, { through: 'C' }); // A BelongsToMany B through the junction table C
